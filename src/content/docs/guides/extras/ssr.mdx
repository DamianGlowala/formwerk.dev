Server side rendering, or SSR, is the process of rendering components on the server and serve them as HTML initially, rather than rendering them on the client. Static Site Generation (SSG) is a similar approach, it renders pages to HTML files at build time rather than on each request. These techniques can help improve perceived loading performance and SEO.

Formwerk is designed to work with server side rendering. It does not rely on any client-side only APIs and should work in any environment that supports Vue.js SSR like Nuxt and Astro.

## Label and Input ID Generation

Formwerk builds on top of `useId` function exposed by Vue.js `>= v3.5.0` to generate unique IDs for labels and inputs. This is why Vue.js `v3.5.0` is the minimum required version for Formwerk.

## SSR and i18n

Since Formwerk cannot detect the site locale on the server, you should explicitly set the locale with the `configure` function.

```ts
// In Nuxt module or Plugin
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

configure({
  locale: 'en-US',
});
```

This configuration will affect the default `dir` properties of all Formwerk components and might change the numerals used in number fields.
