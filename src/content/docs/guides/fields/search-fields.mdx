> Input elements of type search are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into. These are functionally identical to text inputs but may be styled differently by the user agent.

Search fields have extra behaviors and use-cases that set them apart from regular text fields. This composable provides the behavior, state, and accessibility implementation for search fields.

A couple of behaviors set this apart from regular text fields:

- The text content can be cleared with the clear button or a keyboard shortcut.
- They are usually used without a parent `form` element and sometimes without a `submit` button. So they can be submitted with the `Enter` keyboard key on their own.

You can find more information about the differences [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search#differences_between_search_and_text_types).

## Features

- Uses `input[type="search"]` element as a base.
- Labeling, descriptions, and error message displays are automatically linked to input and label elements with `aria-*` attributes.
- Support for a custom clear button.
- Validation support with native HTML constraint validation or [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) validation.
- Support for `v-model` binding.
- Supported Keyboard features:

| Key                               | Description                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Kbd code="Esc" />                | Clears the input value.                                                                             |
| <Kbd code="Enter" label="Enter"/> | If in a form, submits the form. Otherwise, submits the input with the `onSubmit` event or callback. |

## Building a Search Field Component

The `useSearchField` composable returns binding objects for the elements shown in the [anatomy](#anatomy). You will use `v-bind` to bind them to the corresponding DOM elements.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const search = ref('');
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField label="Keywords" placeholder="Search for..." v-model="search" />

  Search value: {{ search }}
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

Notice that we imported the `SearchFieldProps` in the previous example. This is recommended to use as your component prop types. Not only do you get type safety for your component out of it, but it also handles the reactivity aspects of the props so you don't have to. You are free to extend it with your own props or omit the ones you don't need.

## Validation

### HTML Constraints

You can use the following native HTML validation properties to validate the search field:

| Name        | Type               | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `maxLength` | `number`           | The maximum length of characters.    |
| `minLength` | `number`           | The minimum length of characters.    |
| `required`  | `boolean`          | Whether the text field is required.  |
| `pattern`   | `string \| RegExp` | A regular expression for validation. |

<Aside>
  Note that `minLength` and `maxLength` attributes accept a number or a string.
  The string, however, must be parseable as a number. Formwerk takes care of
  typing strings safely and parsing them so you don't have to bind the values as
  numbers.
</Aside>

Here is an example of how to use the `maxLength` and `minLength` properties to limit the text length between 3 and 18 characters.

Assuming you have a `SearchField` component like the one shown above, you can use it like this:

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const search = ref('');
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField
    label="Keywords"
    placeholder="Search for..."
    v-model="search"
    required
    min-length="3"
    max-length="8"
  />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### Standard Schema

`useSearchField` also supports [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) validation through the `schema` prop. This includes multiple providers like [Zod](https://zod.dev/), [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/), [Arktype](https://arktype.dev/), and more.

<Aside>

Depending on the schema validation provider you are using, the API might slightly differ. Check the supported validation providers for more information. In this example, we are using the `zod` schema validation provider.

</Aside>

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from 'zod';
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const schema = z.string().min(3).max(8);
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField
    label="Standard Schema"
    placeholder="Search for..."
    :schema="schema"
  />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### Mixed Validation

All search fields created with Formwerk support mixed validation, which means you can use both HTML constraints and Standard Schemas to validate the field, and they work seamlessly together.

Note that HTML constraints are validated first, so any errors from the HTML constraints will be displayed first. Then, once all HTML constraints are satisfied, the Standard Schema is validated.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from 'zod';
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const schema = z.string().min(3).max(8);
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField
    label="Mixed Validation"
    placeholder="Search for..."
    :schema="schema"
    required
  />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

This makes schemas lighter; however, we recommend sticking to one or the other per form for maintainability.

If you need to disable the native validation, you can do so by setting the `disableHtmlValidation` prop to `true`.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from 'zod';
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const schema = z.string().min(3).max(10);
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField
    label="HTML Validation Disabled"
    placeholder="Search for..."
    disable-html-validation
    :schema="schema"
    required
  />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

You can also disable it globally for all fields. For more information, check out the [Validation](/guides/forms/validation/) guide.

## Usage

### Disabled

You can disable the search field by setting the `disabled` prop to `true`. Disabled fields are not editable, will not be validated, and will not be submitted with the form.

If you need to prevent the user from interacting with the field while still allowing it to submit, consider using `readonly` instead.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField label="Disabled" disabled value="Well..." />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### Readonly

Readonly fields are validated and submitted, but they do not accept user input. The field is still focusable, and the value is copyable. For more info, check the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly).

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField label="Readonly" value="Can't change this" readonly />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### RTL

The search field doesn't really need much for RTL support; however, the `dir` prop can be used to set the direction of the field for convenience.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField label="البحث" placeholder="ابحث عن..." dir="rtl" />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

<Aside>

There is a lot more to directionality and localization. For more info, check out the [i18n guide](/guides/extras/i18n/).

</Aside>

### Submitting

Search fields can be used without a parent `form` element and sometimes without a `submit` button. The `useSearchField` accepts an `onSubmit` callback that is called when the user presses the `Enter` key on the field.

<MdxRepl client:load>

<div slot="!SearchField.vue">
  <SearchFieldPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import SearchField from './SearchField.vue';

const onSubmit = (value: string) => {
  alert(`Searching for: ${value}`);
};
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField label="Search" placeholder="Search for..." @submit="onSubmit" />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

Note that empty search fields can be submitted, so you might want to validate the field before submitting.

## API
